# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars',  is_showing: 'true'}, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' ,  is_showing: 'true'}])
